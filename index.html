My project 

</h1> Bela's food book </h1>

<h3> main purpose of this website is for new beginners , one thing i notice is that new beginners usually mess up with the time control and often times, that even ruins our cooking equipment , such as our pan :(  </h3>

<h3> the website combines both my drawings and customrize recipe that i customrize and a TIMER that you can keep track with your time </h3>
